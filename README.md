# AnimeToManga
This will be an open source project , to convert manga panels into a short anime teaser or trailer. If this is successful, then more resources will be added to churn out long videos.

## This project involves 4 major steps 
### 1. Input Preparation (Panel Handling & Segmentation)

Collect manga panels (scans or original art).
Use auto-segmentation (AnimeSeg, SAM, U²-Net Anime) to separate characters from background.
Organize assets (e.g., character.png, background.png).

### 2. Style & Consistency Control
Make sure generated frames keep the same art style & character identity.
Tools:
Stable Diffusion + ControlNet (Reference/Lineart models).
LoRA/DreamBooth (optional if you need stronger character identity).

### 3. Motion Generation (Core Animation Step)
Convert static panels into animated short clips.
Tools:
AnimateDiff (open-source motion).
Stable Video Diffusion (image → short video).
Pika Labs / Runway Gen-3 (fast SaaS prototyping).
Motions: camera pans, blinking, hair/cloth sway, action effects.

### 4. Scene Sequencing (Multiple Panels → Mini Scene)
Stitch animated clips in manga panel order to form a rough sequence.
Tools:
FFmpeg (CLI, fast stitching).
OpenShot / DaVinci Resolve (if GUI needed).
Output: 10–30 sec animated manga scene.
